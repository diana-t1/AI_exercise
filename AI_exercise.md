## Quick Techniques

When stress hits, try these immediate relief methods:

- Progressive muscle release: tense and release each muscle group, starting from your toes.
- Vestibular reset: gently rotate your head in small circles while seated.

Build these practices into your routine:
- Morning light exposure: 10 minutes of natural sunlight to regulate cortisol.
- Proprioceptive exercises: wall pushes or palm pressing for grounding.
